Yes, these steps resolved the issue for me as well (using VMware player 15 something) and adding the Afterâ€¦ to /usr/lib/systemd/system/vmtoolsd.service, the content is now:

[Unit]
Description=Open Virtual Machine Tools (VMware Tools)
ConditionVirtualization=vmware
After=display-manager.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vmtoolsd

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
